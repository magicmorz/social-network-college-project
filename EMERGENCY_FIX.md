# üö® EMERGENCY FIX: Remove Large Files from Git History

## The Problem
The large MongoDB binary files are already committed in your Git history, so even with `.gitignore`, Git still tries to push them. We need to completely remove them from Git history.

## üîß IMMEDIATE FIX - Follow These Steps Exactly:

### Step 1: Check Git Status
```bash
git status
```

### Step 2: Remove Large Files from Git History
```bash
# Remove the problematic file from entire Git history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch node_modules/.cache/mongodb-memory-server/mongod-arm64-darwin-6.0.14' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

### Step 3: Clean Up Git References
```bash
# Remove backup references
rm -rf .git/refs/original/

# Clean up and optimize repository
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

### Step 4: Force Push the Cleaned Branch
```bash
# Force push to override the remote branch
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/userModel-yossiferoz
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Alternative Solution (If Above Doesn't Work):

If the filter-branch approach doesn't work, we'll create a completely clean branch:

### Step 1: Create a Clean Branch
```bash
# Go to dev branch (the branch you want to merge TO)
git checkout dev

# Delete the problematic branch locally (if it exists)
git branch -D feature/userModel-yossiferoz

# Skip deleting remote branch since it doesn't exist
# (The error shows "remote ref does not exist")

# Create a fresh branch from dev
git checkout -b feature/userModel-yossiferoz-clean
```

### Step 2: Add Only Source Files
```bash
# Add only the source code files (not node_modules)
git add .gitignore
git add models/
git add tests/
git add package.json
git add userExample.js
git add GIT_WORKFLOW.md

# Verify what's being added (should NOT include node_modules)
git status
```

### Step 3: Commit and Push Clean Branch
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add User model with comprehensive unit tests

- Create User model with mongoose schema  
- Add password hashing with bcryptjs
- Implement field validation and unique constraints
- Set up Jest testing framework with MongoDB Memory Server
- Add comprehensive unit tests covering all functionality
- Add .gitignore to prevent tracking node_modules"

git push -u origin feature/userModel-yossiferoz-clean
```

## üéØ What Went Wrong:
1. `node_modules` was accidentally tracked by Git before `.gitignore` was created
2. The MongoDB Memory Server downloaded a 117MB binary file into `node_modules/.cache/`
3. This large file got committed and was trying to be pushed to GitHub
4. GitHub rejects files larger than 100MB

## ‚úÖ Prevention:
- `.gitignore` is now in place to prevent this in the future
- Always create `.gitignore` first in new Node.js projects
- Never commit `node_modules` directory

## üöÄ Next Steps After Fix:
1. Run `npm install` to reinstall dependencies (they won't be tracked by Git)
2. Run `npm test` to verify everything works
3. Create PR from `feature/userModel-yossiferoz-clean` to `dev` branch
